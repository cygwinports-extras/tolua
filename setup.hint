ldesc: "tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ 
code with Lua. Based on a cleaned header file, tolua automatically 
generates the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua 
API and tag method facilities, tolua maps C/C++ constants, external 
variables, functions, classes, and methods to Lua."
